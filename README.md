# Docker Repository

This repository contains several dockerfiles that allows to create containers with GUI for different purposes. You can find more information in each of the folders. These containters are mainly intended to be run on WSL 2 - Win 11.

## GUI with Docker

For instructions about how to allow GUI applications, check [Linux GUI apps on the WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps). Also, the Docker integration with the WSL distro needs to be available. This can be done on the Docker desktop app (Windows side) --> Settings/Resources/WSL integration.
